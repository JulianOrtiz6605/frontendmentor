## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this challenge I figured out how to stretch the picture so that it fills the entire flex element:

```css
img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

### Continued development

I continue to improve in HTML, CSS, JS
